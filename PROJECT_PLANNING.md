# IS 310 – Semester-Long Project  
## Group 5: Project Planning Document

## Group Theme

Our group’s theme centers on **AI technology within academic, online, and social spaces**, with a focus on how technology interacts with communities in increasingly virtualized environments. We are interested in examining AI not only as a technical tool, but as a cultural and social system that shapes learning, communication, productivity, and norms.

Our investigation includes cultural objects and practices connected to virtual spaces that have emerged and evolved over time, particularly within education and online communities.

### Scope of Investigation

**In Scope:**
- AI tools used by students in academic settings
- Online and social media spaces where AI is discussed or used
- Productivity and learning outcomes associated with AI assistance
- Academic integrity concerns related to AI (e.g., plagiarism, cheating)

## Individual Ideas

Each group member will work with an individual dataset that connects back to our shared theme:

- **Student AI Usage & Academic Performance**  
  Dataset exploring student use of AI tools and potential correlations with grades or GPA.

- **AI in Social Spaces & Social Media**  
  Dataset drawn from Reddit threads, Twitter/X posts, or other online forums discussing AI in academic or social contexts.

- **Productivity and Learning Outcomes with AI Assistance**  
  Dataset analyzing how AI tools impact student productivity, time management, or perceived learning outcomes.

- **AI and Academic Integrity**  
  Dataset examining trends in plagiarism, cheating, or academic honesty concerns related to AI use.

These topics are preliminary and may be refined as we continue working on the project and explore data availability.

## Collaboration Plan

### Communication
- Primary communication through group text and email
- In-class time used for group discussions and planning
- Google Docs used for collaborative drafting before finalizing work

### GitHub Organization
- One shared GitHub repository for the group
- Individual folders for each group member’s dataset and analysis
- Collaborative documents will be drafted in Google Docs and then pushed to GitHub
- For each project milestone, a different group member will be responsible for pushing updates to the repository

## Notes
This document represents our initial planning stage. Our datasets, research questions, and analyses may evolve throughout the semester as our project develops.
