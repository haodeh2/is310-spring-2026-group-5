# Digital Objects & Representations

For my focus on productivity and learning outcomes with AI assistance, the primary digital object is the “ChatGPT Student Usage” dataset available through Harvard Dataverse. This dataset represents structured data about how students use ChatGPT in academic contexts. Rather than preserving a finished essay or assignment, the dataset preserves measurable patterns of behavior: frequency of use, types of tasks supported (brainstorming, editing, explaining concepts), perceived productivity gains, and reported academic impact.

This dataset is a digital representation of how students incorporate AI into their learning practices. It transforms individual study behaviors into structured, analyzable data. In this sense, the digital object is not just text produced by AI, but evidence of how AI is integrated into academic workflows. The dataset captures the digitization of learning habits and productivity itself.

Unlike HathiTrust, where the digital object is a scanned cultural artifact, here the digital object is behavioral data. It reflects how students navigate AI tools in real time and how those interactions shape academic output.

# Digitization Processes

The ChatGPT Student Usage dataset is born-digital. The data is collected through online surveys, digital logs, or structured research instruments that record student interaction with AI tools. These responses are exported into machine-readable formats such as CSV files and uploaded to Harvard Dataverse with associated metadata, including author information, keywords, abstracts, and citation identifiers.

This process differs significantly from what we observed in HathiTrust. In HathiTrust, digitization involves scanning physical pages and using OCR to extract text. Errors occur due to font, layout, and formatting challenges. In contrast, AI usage data does not require OCR because it originates digitally. Instead, the digitization process involves structuring, cleaning, anonymizing, and standardizing digital behavioral data.

Where HathiTrust digitizes print culture, the ChatGPT Student Usage dataset digitizes cognitive and academic practices. It preserves not the final artifact, but the process of learning supported by AI.

# Historical Equivalents

Before AI tools, productivity and learning outcomes were documented in physical forms such as handwritten essays, printed assignments, teacher gradebooks, and marginal feedback. Study habits were largely invisible unless students self-reported them. There was little systematic data about how students developed ideas, revised drafts, or sought help.

In contrast, the ChatGPT Student Usage dataset makes these processes measurable. It captures patterns in brainstorming, drafting, editing, and concept clarification through AI assistance. Historically, we could archive finished assignments. Now, we can archive the workflow behind them.

If Kahle references the Library of Alexandria as a model for preserving knowledge, this dataset represents something slightly different: the preservation of knowledge production. It reflects a shift from archiving intellectual products to archiving intellectual processes.

# Born-Digital Materials

The ChatGPT Student Usage dataset is entirely born-digital. The surveys, logs, and interaction records were created digitally and never existed in physical form. This distinguishes it from digitized archives like HathiTrust.

Born-digital materials in this context include:

- ChatGPT interaction transcripts

- AI-assisted drafting sessions

- Productivity metrics

- Self-reported academic outcome surveys

These materials reflect a cultural moment where learning is mediated through digital systems from the beginning. There is no analog original to convert. The archive begins at the moment of digital interaction.

# Oldest Digital Library/Archive

While the ChatGPT Student Usage dataset is recent, it is housed within Harvard Dataverse, which has functioned as a long-term digital research archive since 2007. Harvard Dataverse preserves datasets through standardized metadata, DOI assignment, and version control. This ensures datasets remain accessible and citable over time.

Earlier educational data archives, such as the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, focused primarily on surveys and institutional research data. However, those earlier archives did not capture AI-mediated productivity because the technology did not yet exist.

The ChatGPT Student Usage dataset represents a new type of archived educational data: data about human-AI collaboration in learning.

# Newest Digital Library/Archive

Recent AI-related datasets added to Harvard Dataverse show how digital archives are evolving to accommodate new research questions about AI and education. Compared to older datasets, newer ones include:

 - Structured variables specifically measuring AI frequency of use

 - Variables tracking perceived productivity improvement

 - Machine-readable formats optimized for computational research

 - More detailed documentation about research design

The archive is no longer just preserving survey responses. It is preserving data about algorithmic interaction and cognitive augmentation.

# Viral Examples

The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in 2022 led to widespread viral discussion about students using AI for assignments. Social media posts, news articles, and academic debates highlighted concerns about cheating, but also excitement about productivity gains and enhanced learning.

These viral conversations increased scholarly interest in measuring actual student behavior. Datasets like ChatGPT Student Usage emerged in response to this cultural moment. The digital object (student-AI interaction data) became important not only socially but academically, prompting formal archiving and research.

# Free vs. Proprietary Access

Harvard Dataverse is largely open-access, meaning many datasets, including ChatGPT Student Usage, can be downloaded freely for research purposes. The platform emphasizes preservation, citation, and public scholarly access.

In contrast, proprietary educational platforms such as Blackboard and Coursera collect extensive learning analytics data but do not make raw productivity data publicly available. Their data is stored internally and often monetized.

This contrast reflects Besser’s distinction between public digital libraries and commercial digital platforms. Harvard Dataverse supports transparency and reproducibility, while proprietary platforms prioritize institutional control and market value.
